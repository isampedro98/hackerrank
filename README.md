# HackerRank Solutions
This repository contains my solutions to relevant coding challenges on HackerRank. 

Each solution is implemented in TypeScript and is organized by topic or challenge category. 

My goal is to improve problem-solving skills and explore efficient algorithms.

## Table of Contents
- [Project Structure](#project-structure)
- [Languages Used](#languages-used)
- [How to Use](#how-to-use)

## Project Structure
- **/Algorithms** - Solutions to algorithmic challenges.
- **/DataStructures** - Solutions focused on data structure challenges.
- **/OtherCategories** - Other challenge categories (e.g., SQL, mathematics).
Each folder contains subfolders named by challenge or problem type, with solutions written in TypeScript.

## Languages Used
- **TypeScript**: All solutions are implemented in TypeScript for better type safety and clarity.

## How to Use
1. **Clone the Repository**: Clone the repository to your local machine using `git clone https://github.com/isampedro98/hackerrank.git`.
2. **Navigate**: Browse through the folders to find solutions.
3. **Run a Solution**: Make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed. To run a TypeScript solution, navigate to the solution file and use:
   ```bash
   npx ts-node <file-name>.ts
